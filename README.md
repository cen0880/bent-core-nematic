# bent-core-nematic

The code for the manuscript "Confinement effects on the cybotactic clusters of bent-core nematic liquid crystals".

Q_P.m is the code for generating all two-dimensional results. The D8e3_AN05_lambda1e2.mat and D8e3_AN05_lambda1e2.png  are the corresponding data and images. 

Other programs, apart from Q_P.m, are responsible for generating the bifurcation diagrams of polynomial solutions under different parameters. Here, "PA" signifies A=0.04, "NA" indicates A=-0.04, "low" refers to A=-0.5, "zero" means Eel=0, and "NM" represents M=-9.7e-5. The detailed comments are provided within PA.m, which can be used as a reference for understanding the other programs.
